                                                <li><b>ECG (Electrocardiogram)</b>
                                                <p>More commonly known as ECG, Electrocardiogram is a process used to find out if your heart is functioning normally. It studies the electrical activity of the heart during a normal cardiac cycle. It is one of the tests recommended by cardiologists for patients who present themselves with chest pain or difficulty in breathing to rule out any cardiac issue. 
                                                    ECG is a completely safe and non-invasive procedure and does not take long. There are no restrictions on the patients before taking up this test.
                                                    </p>
                                             </li>
                                                <li><b> Echocardiogram</b>
                                                <p>Cardiologists recommend this slightly advanced diagnostic process to conduct a slightly deeper study of your heart. An Echocardiogram generates images of your heart using sound waves. Your cardiologist can take a deeper look into heart performance and identify heart diseases if any. Echocardiograms are of several types. Based on the information needed, your doctor will suggest the type required. </p></li>
                                                <li><b>Angiogram</b>
                                                <p>An angiogram is a procedure that identifies a blocked artery. Your cardiac surgeon will inject a dye into the heart’s blood vessels. This process utilises X-Ray images to study your heart’s blood vessels.  The reactions of the blood vessels are immediately captured by the X-Ray machine allowing your doctor to instantly plan the next course of treatment. An angiogram is a safe procedure and cardiologists associated with the best cardiology hospital in Bangalore, have abundant experience in giving a picture-perfect diagnosis.</p></li>
                                                <li><b>Angioplasty (Cardiac catheterisation)</b>
                                                <p>This is a slightly advanced surgical procedure suggested by cardiologists to remove blocks found in the coronary artery. This procedure sees your surgeon insert a small balloon catheter which widens the blocked artery. This ensures a seamless flow of blood into your heart. This process is accompanied by another small procedure called stent implantation. The stent or a wire mesh ensures that the artery worked on continues to stay wide without interrupting the blood flow. A team of some of the best cardiologists in Bangalore working at CANS Hospital have a proven track record of conducting many successful Angioplasty surgeries and they continue to do so. </p></li>
                                                <li><b>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) </b>
                                                <p>A slightly more complex procedure compared to an Angioplasty is CABG or Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting. It is usually recommended as an immediate solution for patients who are diagnosed with blocks in multiple arteries. The blocks are caused due to deposits of hard substances called plaque in the artery which blocks the blood flow. <br>
                                                    In this process, your cardiac surgeon bypasses the blocked artery by connecting a healthy artery taken from a different part of your body.  Thanks to the use of technology, CABG has seen a lot of success in recent years. Additionally, our competent surgical team at CANS Hospital, the most trusted cardiac hospital in Bangalore, combine surgical finesse with technology to the fullest extent while performing CABG surgeries. </p></li>
                                                <li><b>Diabetes Management</b>
                                                <p>The word Diabetes is commonly heard in almost every household.  Effectively managing diabetes is extremely critical especially due to the amount of damage it can cause during the later stages of your life. It is important to keep your sugar levels in check by frequently talking up diabetes tests. Our efficient physicians and Endocrinologists at CANS Hospital, the best hospital in Bangalore have kept many faces happy and smiling with a perfectly disciplined Diabetes Management program.</p> </li>
