                                          <p>Obstetrics and Gynaecology are two separate branches of medicine that focus exclusively on health conditions related to women.  While Obstetrics looks into pregnancy and childbirth, Gynaecology focuses on issues related to a woman’s reproductive system. Medical experts who look exclusively into these two conditions are referred to as Obstetricians and Gynaecologists respectively.  </p>
                                          <p>While both are different specialities, an experienced medical expert in these two fields can contribute as an obstetrician as well as a gynaecologist. 
                                           <br> Looking into the criticality involved with OBG, CANS Hospital has set up an extremely hygienic and infection-free environment as we accord the topmost priority to patient comfort. This makes CANS Hospital as the <b> Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital in Bangalore </b>with a difference.
                                            </p>
