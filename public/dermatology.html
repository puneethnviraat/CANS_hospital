The PRP or Platelet Rich Plasma method is a proven method for cosmetic rejuvenation and is successfully employed to remove wrinkles and scars from the face. This process involves drawing a small quantity of blood, usually from your arm and then separating the plate-rich plasma from the blood by putting it into a centrifuge. This plasma is then injected back into the body through the area the blood was drawn from to facilitate hair growth. PRP is a safe procedure and usually does not lead to any complications.

                                                        Eczema is a type of Dermatitis (a condition causing skin inflammation) which is usually not contagious. However, if ignored it can lead to more serious complications. In this condition, the skin becomes dry and starts itching.  Excema does not cause pain but can lead to more complications like deep skin infections or even skin cancer, if not attended to by a qualified dermatologist immediately.

                                                        Skin Biopsy is a test procedure used to diagnose critical skin infections, skin cancers or even the cause of rashes. In this process, your dermatologist takes a small portion of your skin and studies it more deeply for the possibility of major complications. Skin Biopsy is usually handled by experienced dermatologists as it is done under local anaesthesia.
